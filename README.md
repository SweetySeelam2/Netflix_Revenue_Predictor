Optimizing Content Lifecycle and Revenue Forecasting for Streaming Platforms with Advanced Predictive Analytics

Subtitle:
Leveraging Data Science to Forecast Content Performance, Optimize Licensing, and Maximize Revenue Streams for Global Streaming Services

Project Overview:
This project focuses on Netflix and other major streaming platforms, providing a comprehensive analysis of their content lifecycle, from acquisition to user engagement. By utilizing advanced predictive analytics, we aim to forecast how content (both original and licensed) will perform across regions, genres, and user engagement levels. The project will optimize content licensing, production investments, and revenue forecasting, ultimately maximizing ROI for streaming services.

This project integrates machine learning models, SQL for data querying and cleaning, and Tableau for creating actionable, visually appealing dashboards that provide business insights. By combining real-world datasets from multiple sources (Netflix, IMDb, Box Office Mojo, etc.), the goal is to deliver actionable content strategy recommendations that can help Netflix and other platforms make data-driven decisions on content investment.

Objective/Goal:
The primary objective of this project is to provide streaming platforms like Netflix with insights into:

Forecasting content performance based on historical data and predictive models.

Optimizing content lifecycle by analyzing when to rotate out or refresh content.

Improving revenue forecasting by understanding the impact of content types (original vs. licensed), licensing agreements, and subscription models.

Delivering business recommendations on content acquisition strategies and licensing optimizations.

Dataset Information:
The following datasets are used for the project:

Mojo_budget_data.csv: Contains detailed financials (budget, revenue by region) and content metadata (director, actors, genre).

Mojo_budget_update.csv: Offers additional metadata such as release date, distributor, and trivia, useful for tracking content performance over time.

movies_metadata.csv: Provides metadata for movies (genres, revenue, runtime, spoken languages), useful for content performance analysis.

netflix_movies_tvshows.csv: Contains metadata for Netflix's content catalog (type, title, country, date added, etc.).

ratings.csv: Includes user ratings for Netflix content, allowing analysis of viewer engagement and content popularity.

title.basics.tsv: Provides title metadata including genre, runtime, and movie type.

title.ratings.tsv: Includes ratings and vote counts for each title, helpful for understanding audience reception.

title.principals.tsv: Contains information about the principal cast and crew, which can be used to assess the impact of talent on content success.















üéØ Project Title:
‚ÄúNetflix‚Äôs Content Investment Efficiency: Analyzing Production Costs, Licensing Trends, and Demand Value‚Äù

üìå OVERVIEW
Goal: Deliver business recommendations to Netflix by analyzing how efficiently it spends on content production vs. content demand and licensing.
Approach: Use external datasets (Parrot Analytics, Statista, IMDb, TMDb), perform SQL-based analysis, and visualize insights in Tableau.

üß† Why This Project? (Real-World Business Problem)
Netflix has massively scaled its content production ‚Äî spending billions on Originals and licensing. However, not every expensive show leads to audience demand or retention. Netflix needs to optimize what type of content is worth investing in and identify which content delivers high value at lower cost.

üíº Business Objective:
You will analyze:

Which content types or genres are high cost but low value (wasteful)?

Which content is low-cost but drives high demand (efficient)?

Whether Netflix Originals are worth the money compared to licensed content.

Trends over years: Has spending become more efficient?


‚úÖ Step 4.3: Create Dashboard Pages

üì¢ PHASE 5: BUSINESS STORYTELLING & RECOMMENDATIONS
‚úÖ Key Questions to Answer
Which genres are high-cost but low in demand?

Are Netflix Originals cost-effective compared to licensed titles?

What are the best-performing titles per dollar spent?

‚úÖ Example Recommendations
üîÅ Reallocate budget from high-cost/low-demand genres (e.g., experimental drama) to proven hits (e.g., action or thriller).

üíº Prioritize licensing in regions with cheaper high-demand content.

üß† Develop spin-offs from low-budget high-demand originals.
